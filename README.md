# Medline-IR-System

## Description:
This project showcases the development of an information retrieval (IR) system tailored for the Medline collection, a standard test corpus in the field of information retrieval. The system implements the inverted index retrieval algorithm, enabling efficient querying of documents based on relevance to user queries. Additionally, the system incorporates the Mean Average Precision (MAP) evaluation metric to assess its performance in retrieving relevant documents.

## Key Features:

**Inverted Index Retrieval**: Utilizes an inverted index data structure to efficiently index terms and documents, enabling fast retrieval of relevant documents for user queries.

**Query Processing**: Processes user queries by tokenizing, stemming, and filtering stopwords to generate query vectors for comparison with document vectors.

**Cosine Similarity Ranking**: Ranks documents based on their cosine similarity with the query vector, ensuring that the most relevant documents are retrieved first.

**MAP Evaluation**: Implements the Mean Average Precision (MAP) evaluation metric to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the retrieval system in returning relevant documents for a given set of queries.

**Result Visualization**: Outputs ranked lists of documents for each query, facilitating easy interpretation and analysis of the retrieval system's performance.

This project demonstrates proficiency in information retrieval techniques, including index construction, query processing, and relevance ranking, as well as evaluation methodologies such as MAP. The implementation can serve as a foundation for building more advanced IR systems and conducting research in the field of information retrieval and natural language processing.
